**`Student Developer`**

I'm a student studying computer science at California State University, Northridge and while I still have a lot to learn, I couldn't be more excited to do so!
As a self proclaimed problem solver, it is my greatest privelage to be able to learn the skills necessary to do so in the digital age.
Most of my projects are school assignments at the moment but I'm always excited to put my own twist when I can.
